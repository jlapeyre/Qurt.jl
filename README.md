This repo is explores design of data structures and functions for quantum circuits. The goal is to find the best design for use in a compiler.

The repo includes an implementation of some ideas in Julia. Many of the design choices are not specific to Julia

Here are some [notes on design considerations](./DesignConsiderations.md).
